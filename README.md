## About Me

With a high level of focus and energy, I consistently delve deeply into and gain precise understanding of my areas of interest. As a flexible individual, I plan my life’s trajectory around the fields I am passionate about. By enhancing my language skills, I have aimed to expand my communication beyond my workplace and connect with individuals from various backgrounds, not limiting my assistance solely to my colleagues.

From my work experiences in networking and security, monitoring, data center and organizational network management, troubleshooting, and system support, I have realized that every action impacts data analysis and have understood the relationship between database processes, operating systems, and software. Interested in exploration and learning, I dedicate my time to developing and expanding my knowledge in my areas of interest. My life is based on adventure, growth, and a deep understanding of concepts, and I have always aimed to reach my best version..
